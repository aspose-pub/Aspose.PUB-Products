<p>
Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Publisher document file format used for creating various publication types such as newsletters, brochures, flyers and postcards as well as used in Emails and Websites. Pub files contains text as well as bitmatp and vector graphics data. 
</p>

<p>
Even though the format is quite popular it is not that popular as such formats as PDF or DOCX. MS Publisher application is not free itself. So it is often required to convert files with .pub extension to another, well-spread and comfortable-to-use format. Here is the conversion functionality for Java. This .NET library includes the needed conversion functionality that can be used for creation your own project.
