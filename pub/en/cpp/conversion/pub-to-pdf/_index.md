Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Publisher document file format is used for creating various publication types such as newsletters, brochures, flyers, and postcards and is used in Emails and Websites. Pub files contain text as well as bitmap and vector graphics data.
</p>
<p>
As all the other Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> products Publisher application is not free itself. And as the file of the format can be opened only by this program to share the results of your work sometimes you will have to convert a PUB file to a more well-spread format. The most popular of all is PUB to PDF conversion. By now, this format is supported by all modern devices and can even be opened in a browser without installing any additional software. Here is the PUB to PDF conversion functionality for C++. This library can also be used for creating your own project.
</p>
<p>
Before running the conversion you need to integrate C++ PUB to PDF Converter API, which works not only with single-page documents but also supports multipage .pub files.
