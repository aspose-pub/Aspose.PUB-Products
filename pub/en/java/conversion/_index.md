<p>
Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Publisher document file format is used for creating various publication types such as newsletters, brochures, flyers, and postcards and is used in Emails and Websites. Pub files contain text as well as bitmap and vector graphics data.
</p>

<p>
Even though the format is quite popular it is not as popular as such formats as PDF or DOCX. MS Publisher application is not free itself. So it is often required to convert files with .pub extension to another, well-spread and comfortable-to-use format. Here is the conversion functionality for Java. This library includes the needed conversion functionality that can be used for the creation of your own project.

Letâ€™s look at the functionality through the PUB to PDF conversion.

The publisher Conversion process consists of the next steps:

1. Integrate Java PUB to PDF Converter API, which works not only with single-page documents but also supports multipage .pub files.

2. Load PUB file using the [*PubFactory*](https://reference.aspose.com/pub/java/com.aspose.pub/PubFactory) Class.

3. CreateParser and Parse via the [*Parse*](https://reference.aspose.com/pub/java/com.aspose.pub/IPubParser#parse--) Method of the [*IPubParser*](https://reference.aspose.com/pub/java/com.aspose.pub/IPubParser) Interface. 

4. Run the conversion by means of the [*ConvertToPdf*](https://reference.aspose.com/pub/java/com.aspose.pub/IPdfConverter#convertToPdf-com.aspose.pub.Document-java.io.OutputStream-) Method.
