<p>
Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Publisher document file format is used for creating various publication types such as newsletters, brochures, flyers, and postcards and is used in Emails and Websites. Pub files contain text as well as bitmap and vector graphics data.
</p>
<p>
Publisher Metadata is properties(information) that describe PUB documents. They are standard properties like publisher, title, last author, organization, URL, language, and other similar information. There is also data that is generated automatically after working with a file like its size or the last editing time. This useful information is stored along with the document. 
</p>
<p>
Along with Conversion and Reading functionality, this PUB API solution for Java lets you edit standard metadata by means of the DocSummaryInfo and SummaryInfo classes as shown in the following code sample. You may also use the API to create your own Metadata Editor application.
