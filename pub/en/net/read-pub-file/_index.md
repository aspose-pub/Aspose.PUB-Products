{{<section overview>}}

p1: Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Publisher document file format is used for creating various publication types such as newsletters, brochures, flyers, and postcards and is used in Emails and Websites. Pub files contain text, tables as well as bitmap and vector graphics data.
p2: Even though the format is quite popular it is not as popular as such formats as PDF or DOCX. MS Publisher application is not free itself.  
p3: So sometimes it is required to open PUB files without this program. This is needed when you want to show the document's content, without editing or manipulating it any other way, like when you have a presentation or review. For such purposes, you may use a cross-platform PUB Viewer application.
p4: Here you will get the .NET API Solution that lets you view the MS Publisher document's properties such as size, width, height, names of the used fonts, the number of fields, and colors.
